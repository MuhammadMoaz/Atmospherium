# Atmospherium
Atmospherium is a dynamic web application I created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide real-time weather updates and forecasts. I integrated the OpenWeatherMap API to display current weather conditions, hourly forecasts, and weekly weather statistics for user-specified cities.

You can find it deployed at: [atmospherium.vercel.app](https://atmospherium.vercel.app).

Powered by OpenWeatherMap API.
