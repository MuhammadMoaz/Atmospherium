# Atmospherium
Atmospherium is a dynamic web application I cretaed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide real-time weather updates and forecasts. I integrated the OpenWeatherMap API to display current weather conditions, hourly forecasts, and weekly weather statistics for user-specified cities.

Powered by OpenWeatherMap API.
